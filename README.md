# Learning Git pages, actions and dev containers.

A playground for git pages, CI/CD with git and devcontainers. You really don't need to be 
reading this. I know, I know ... the file is literally called README. 

## Steps

### Getting a hosted page up us git pages

- [x] create a directory that contains a static website
- [x] host this directory

Some notes to myself on these steps;

- The host directory seems to be either `/docs` or `/`
- I went with with `/docs`
- Host here: https://deadlygeek.github.io/git-pages-actions-playground/ 
- You can see you host informatiopn in the page tab of settings

### Syncing up my local version of v-code with this version.

All of this code was written online in code spaces.
