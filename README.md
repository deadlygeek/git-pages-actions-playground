# Learning Git pages, actions and dev containers.

A playground for git pages, CI/CD with git and devcontainers. You really don't need to be
reading this. I know, I know ... the file is literally called README and it is what is shown
to you by default. Be wared that I am using is here as a place to record my note. I don't
really expect this to be useful for others.
